# BI Analyst Case Study

This repository contains my submission for the **(Senior) BI Analyst Case Study** as part of the selection process for a job I applied to.

## üìÑ Overview 

The case study consists of two main parts:

1. **Business Analysis Presentation**  
   A concise, business-oriented analysis focused on uncovering key insights from the data to support strategic decision-making.

2. **SQL Mock Query**  
   A written SQL solution to a realistic business scenario, demonstrating my proficiency in data querying and logical structuring.

## üìä Part 1: Analysis 

### Selected Analysis: *Sales Performance Analysis*  

The analysis explores:
- revenue trends across different regions
- revenue trends across sales channels
- revenue trends across product types

**Tools used:** Python, Visual Studio Code, Looker Studio

**SQL Dialect:** SQLite

**Deliverable:** A 15-minute presentation via Looker Studio intended for a leadership audience.

[Link to Dataset](sales.csv)

**Key Findings:**

- Profit in the B2B sector (18 Mil. $) is more than twice as large as profit in the B2C sector (8 Mil. $).
- Profit margin is very similar in all geographic regions.
- While the average order value is similar online vs. in-store, ca. 35% more revenue is produced via in-store purchases.
- The return percentage for "premium brake pads" is more than 80% higher than the return percentage for "non-premium brake pads". As more than 5 times more revenue is generated with "premium brake pads", reducing their return percentage is a massive opportunity to increase revenue.

## üßÆ Part 2: SQL Mock Query

### Task:   
Write a query comparing online and offline sales channel performance by region for the past six
months. Your query should output total revenue, total returns, and the proportion of returned
units compared to units sold. Also, identify regions with return proportions higher than the
average.

Expected Output Schema:

+ region
+ channel (online/offline)
+ total_revenue
+ total_returns
+ return_proportion
+ above_average_return (boolean indicating if return proportion is above average)
  
**Tools used:** Python, Visual Studio Code

**SQL Dialect:** SQLite
